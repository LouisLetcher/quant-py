## Introduction

`quant-python` provides ready-to-use Python scripts and modules that help traders and analysts build algorithmic trading systems, conduct technical analysis, and perform robust backtesting. By leveraging the flexibility and power of Python, you can easily integrate these tools into your existing workflow, whether it’s for live trading, paper trading, or historical market analysis.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Dependencies:**  
  Common Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ta` (for technical analysis), and any other specified dependencies required by individual scripts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quant-python.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd quant-python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

### Strategies and Indicators
Inside the strategies and indicators directories, you’ll find Python scripts and modules that you can run or import into your own projects.

**Example (Running a Sample Strategy):**
```bash
python strategies/sample_strategy.py
```

Customize parameters within the script or pass command-line arguments if supported.

### Integration with Trading Platforms
Many Python-based trading frameworks (e.g., Backtrader, Zipline, or freqtrade) allow easy integration of custom strategies and indicators. Refer to the documentation of the specific platform to incorporate these scripts directly.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have developed a Python strategy, indicator, or tool that you’d like to share:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Add your script along with a brief README in the appropriate directory.
3. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the project’s coding standards.
4. Open a Pull Request, providing a clear description of what your contribution does and how it can be used.
